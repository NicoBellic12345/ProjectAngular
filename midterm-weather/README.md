Midterm Weather App - source scaffold
------------------------------------
This archive contains a ready-to-edit Angular project scaffold (source files only),
built to work with Angular CLI 20.3.7 and Node.js 22.x.

To use:
1) Extract or open this folder.
2) Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3) Run `ng serve --open` to start the dev server (or `npm start`).

Notes:
- This is source code only (no node_modules).
- If you used a different Angular CLI version globally, prefer using:
  npx @angular/cli@20.3.7 serve
